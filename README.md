# AmericanRoadTrip
Use Folium mapping library to visualize the route taken during a roadtrip across the USA

By compiling a list of locations and geocodes collected from receipts, FourSquare (now Swarm) check-ins, and a select number of photographs, I hope to find the exact route taken during my 2013 roadtrip from NYC to San Francisco.

Experiment with Folium mapping library and eventually embed into my personal Django site.
